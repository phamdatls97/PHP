    <div>The font family of a text is set with the font-family property.

        The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font, and so on.

        Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.

        Note: If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".

        More than one font family is specified in a comma-separated list:</div>
